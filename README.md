# FreeCodeCamp Survey Form Project

This repository contains my completed FreeCodeCamp survey form project. The project was created as part of the FreeCodeCamp curriculum.

## Project Overview

I designed the survey form differently from the freeCodeCamp survey form to demonstrate my understanding of HTML and CSS concepts. It showcases my ability to create a responsive form using various form elements, such as text inputs, checkboxes, radio buttons, and a submit button.

## Project Structure

The project is structured as follows:

- `index.html` - The main HTML file containing the survey form structure.
- `styles.css` - The CSS file that styles the survey form.

## Preview

Here's a screenshot of the survey form:

## Resources

In this project, I utilized the following resources:

- [FreeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/) - The platform providing the project guidelines and requirements.

Feel free to explore the code and provide any feedback or suggestions for improvement.

Happy coding!
